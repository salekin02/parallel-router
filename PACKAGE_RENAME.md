# Package Rename Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

Your package has been renamed from `@parallel-router/core` to **`parallel-router`**

**Version:** `0.0.1` (indicates early development, no beta tag needed)

### Why These Changes?

1. **Simpler name** - Easier to remember and type
2. **Unscoped package** - No need for `--access public` flag when publishing
3. **Less confusing** - No `/core` suffix that implies multiple subpackages
4. **Available on npm** - The name `parallel-router` was available
5. **Version 0.0.1** - Clear indication of early stage without needing beta tags

### What Changed?

- ✅ `package.json` → name updated to `parallel-router`
- ✅ `README.md` → all import/install examples updated
- ✅ `PUBLISHING_GUIDE.md` → commands updated, removed `--access public`
- ✅ All documentation files → updated to use new package name
- ✅ Package rebuilt successfully

### New Installation

```bash
npm install parallel-router
```

### New Import

```typescript
import { ParallelRouterProvider, ParallelSidebar, Link } from 'parallel-router';
import 'parallel-router/styles.css';
```

### Publishing Command

```bash
npm publish
```

(Simple command - unscoped packages are public by default, no beta tag needed)

## 📝 Scoped vs Unscoped Packages

### Unscoped (What you have now)
- **Package name:** `parallel-router`
- **Install:** `npm install parallel-router`
- **Import:** `from 'parallel-router'`
- **Public by default** ✅
- **No namespace** - Simple and clean

### Scoped (What you had before)
- **Package name:** `@parallel-router/core`
- **Install:** `npm install @parallel-router/core`
- **Import:** `from '@parallel-router/core'`
- **Private by default** - Need `--access public` flag
- **Namespace** - Good for multiple related packages (monorepos)

### When to Use Scoped?
- You plan to publish multiple related packages:
  - `@parallel-router/core`
  - `@parallel-router/sidebar`
  - `@parallel-router/utils`
- You want a unique namespace to avoid naming conflicts
- You're building a monorepo

### When to Use Unscoped?
- You have a single package ✅ (Your case)
- You want the simplest possible name
- The name is available on npm

## 🎯 Summary

**Old:** `npm install @parallel-router/core` (scoped, beta tagged)  
**New:** `npm install parallel-router` (simple, version 0.0.1)

**Version Strategy:**
- `0.0.1` clearly indicates early development
- No need for beta tags - semantic versioning communicates the stage
- Users understand that `0.0.x` is pre-stable

Your package is now simpler, cleaner, and ready to publish! 🚀
